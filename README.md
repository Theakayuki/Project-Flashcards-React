# Flashcard - O - Matic

## A simple flashcard app for learning new things

This is a Project for Thankful that I am working on. It is using an pre-setup mock json server for the back end. That I will utilize to create a flashcard app that will allow users to create their own flashcards and save them to the server. The app will also allow users to view other users flashcards and save them to their own account.
